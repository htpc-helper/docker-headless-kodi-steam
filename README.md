# DEPRECATED - Docker container image with "headless" VNC session

Docker image is installed with the following components:

* Desktop environment [**Xfce4**](http://www.xfce.org)
* VNC-Server (default VNC port `5900`)
* Chromium browser
* Kodi
* Steam

## This image is no longer maintained
The purose of creating this image was to see if Steam streaming worked in a Docker container. What I learned is that without a dedicated GPU, it is not worthwhile.

**This image is dervied from work by ConSol Software GmbH** <br/>
